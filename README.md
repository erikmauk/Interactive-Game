Computational Art: Final Project (Escape the Prison Game)

This is my final project for my Introduction to Computing: Computational Art class. 
I worked on this project with two people whose names should be familiar by now if you 
have seen my other Computational Art labs and projects: Victoria Rund and Kaylee Kitayama.

This project encapsulates most, if not all of the principles that were covered over the quarter.
Another aspect of our project that is recycled code is the duck (except for his wardrobe change). Anyways, the user is
given three choices on each level that if they select the correct choice, they move on to the next stage.
If the wrong option is clicked, a screen that says "YOU WERE CAUGHT" will appear.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!

And with this repository, my Computational Art contributions come to a close. I really do hope that my attempts at
being creative entertained you or helped you in any way. 
Thank you for taking the time to check out my work: it means the world to me!
